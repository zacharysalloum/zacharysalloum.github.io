The inspiration for this project came from the first 3D printer I owned: a Creality Ender 3. I bought that machine for $150, and it taught me much about 3D printing and additive manufacturing. However, the machine was often inconsistent. The products were not always dimensionally accurate, print quality fluctuated, and the printer could not reliably operate at speeds abouve 60mm/s. I searched to create a custom 3D printer that addresses all of these issues, and has an even larger build volume. The final product leverages the strengths of several different commerically available 3D printers, while addressing many of their design weaknesses.

This project was limited by several key constraints. First, it had a total budget of $1000. All material and development costs were not able to exceed that figure. Next, the 3D printer must be able to be built without the use of advanced machining processes (mill, lathe, CNC). Since I did not have access to a machine shop, it was necessary that all custom parts on the machine are able to be 3D printed rather than machined. Additionally, the finished product must be able to print at 100mm/s while retaining tolerances of +/- 0.5mm. At speeds of 50mm/s, it must have tolerances of +/- 0.2mm or better. Finally, the printer must be able to be easy to operate, with a screen that displays relevant information about print time and temperature readings.

The first step in the build was assembling the frame. 2020 and 2040 aluminum extrusions stood out as the most effective material for several reasons. First, they are affordable and readily available at a multitude of different sizes. Additionally, they are lightweight, stiff, and able to be fastened together easily. Aluminum profiles can be quixkly fixed together with brackets, screws, and t-nuts. This allows for quick assembly and prototyping. It also makes the process of fastening components to the frame simple, as t-nuts can be inserted directly into the extrusions, eliminating the need to tap threads.

After the assembly of the frame, the next step was mounting the Y and Z axis linear rods This was accomplished by fabricating custom parts that were 3D printed and mounted to the frame to secure the rods in place. Additionally, custom motor mounts were designed and mounted to attach the Y and Z axis stepper motors. Various other parts were also fabricated, including mounts for endstop sensors and the Y axis belt pulley mount.
