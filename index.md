## Custom 3D Printer Build - Passion Project

### <u>About</u>

#### This inspiration for this project came from the first 3D printer I owned: a Creality Ender 3. I bought that machine for $150, and it taught me much about 3D printing and additive manufacturing. However, the often inconsistent results and performance of the machine caused me to explore what goes into making a 3D printer that prints rapidly, has a large build space, and produces dimensionally accurate results. The final product leverages the strengths of several different commerically available 3D printers, while addressing many of their design weaknesses.
